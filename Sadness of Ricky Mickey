One day, Ricky Mickey was writng an essay.
Suddenly, he got a paper cut.
He was feeling very cranky, but he couldn't do anything about it.
So, he put on a brave face and carried on with the day like nothing was wrong.
When the day was over, he lay down on his bed to rest and started crying profusely.
