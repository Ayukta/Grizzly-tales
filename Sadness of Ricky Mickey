One day, Ricky Mickey was writng an essay.
Suddenly, he got a paper cut.
He was feeling very cranky. After a while, he couldn't take it anymore and called up his friend, Shiny Minnie.
He told her all about the paper cut.
Shiny Minnie empathised. 
Soon, Ricky found himself cracking jokes about his paper cut agony. 
Finally, they said their goodbyes and promised to Netflix on Zoom soon.
